# CMPE-258-Assignment-3 Tensor Operations Practice
# Tensor Operations in TensorFlow and PyTorch

## Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks exploring various tensor operations in **TensorFlow 2.0** and **PyTorch**. Understanding tensor operations is fundamental for mastering deep learning, as tensors serve as the building blocks of all computations in modern machine learning.

## Contents
1. **TensorFlow 2.0 Tensor Operations**
   - Basic tensor creation and manipulation
   - Arithmetic and logical operations
   - Indexing, slicing, and reshaping tensors
   - Broadcasting and element-wise operations
   - Matrix operations including dot product and transposition
   - Advanced tensor operations with **Einsum**
   - Real-world examples and use cases
   
2. **PyTorch Tensor Operations**
   - Creating and modifying tensors
   - Arithmetic and element-wise operations
   - Indexing, slicing, and reshaping
   - Broadcasting and reduction operations
   - Linear algebra operations
   - Introduction to **Einops** for tensor manipulation
   - Advanced techniques for optimizing tensor computations

## Video Demonstration
A comprehensive video walkthrough of the tensor operations implemented in both frameworks is available at:

[Watch the Tensor Operations Tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/S7-uHfZLDcA)

The video covers:
- Live demonstrations of key tensor operations
- Comparisons between TensorFlow and PyTorch approaches
- Practical applications and performance considerations
- Advanced tensor manipulation techniques
